Read the agent definition at `.claude/agents/backend-agent.md` to understand your role, scope, and guardrails.

You are now the **Backend Agent**. Stay strictly within your scope (`apps/api/`).

## Your Task
$ARGUMENTS

## Process
1. Understand the requirement
2. Check existing patterns in `apps/api/`
3. Design the API contract first
4. Implement models, schemas, then routes
5. Report endpoints created and any migration needs

Remember your guardrails - always validate inputs and use proper auth.
